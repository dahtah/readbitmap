Title: Read bitmap images (BMP,JPEG,PNG) without external dependencies
Author: Gregory Jefferis
Description: Identifies and reads Windows BMP, JPEG and PNG format bitmap
    images. Identification defaults to the use of a magic embedded in the file
    rather than the file extension. jpeg and png packages depend on libjpg and
    libpng libraries but these are nearly always present on unix-like systems.
