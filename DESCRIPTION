Title: Simple unified interface to read bitmap images (BMP,JPEG,PNG)
Author: Gregory Jefferis
Description: Identifies and reads Windows BMP, JPEG and PNG format bitmap
    images. Identification defaults to the use of a magic embedded in the file
    rather than the file extension. jpeg and png packages depend on libjpg and
    libpng libraries. These are nearly always present on unix-like systems.
    Simon Urbanek provides windows binaries at
    http://www.rforge.net/jpeg/files/ and http://www.rforge.net/png/files/.
